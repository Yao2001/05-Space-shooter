Peer's repository: https://github.com/Yao2001/05-Space-Shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 The importance of making sure certain functions aren't missing.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 The program doesn't really work (at least for me), so I didn't see much to take from.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 The main errors seem to be the program not being able to get open_color to work, and issues with "no value argument" for the window
 variable and its attributes (width, height, title). I also had trouble getting these to work at first, but right now I can't
 recall how I fixed these problems myself. (I did however fix a few other errors that were easy to solve)

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 Most of the code seems pretty clear.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The errors the python terminal has given me are confusing, because while the code looks like it should work, these
 errors say otherwise. 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Seems descriptive enough.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Even though it doesn't work for me, the idea of a rock shooter seems funny.
